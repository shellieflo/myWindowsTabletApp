Your risk of some health problems is affected by where your body fat is stored, as well as by your weight. Carrying too much fat around your waist can increase your risk of developing conditions such as:
heart disease
type 2 diabetes
& cancer
To measure your waist:
Find the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hips and breathe out naturally.
wrap a tape measure around your waist midway between these points to find your measurement.
You have a higher risk of health problems if your waist size is: more than 80cm and even higher again if your waist size is more than 88cm.
