Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height.
It is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. 
It does not measure body fat directly.
Research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat, such as underwater weighing and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. 
BMI can be considered an alternative for direct measures of body fat.
It is an inexpensive and easy method of screening for weight categories that may lead to health problems.
