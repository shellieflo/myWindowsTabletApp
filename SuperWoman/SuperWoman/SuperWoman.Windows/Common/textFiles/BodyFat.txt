The body fat percentage is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass.

The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. 

The percentage of essential fat is 8–12% in women.

The body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level,  since it is the only body measurement which directly calculates a person's relative body composition without regard to height or weight. 

While BMI largely increases as adiposity increases, due to differences in body composition, 
other indicators of body fat give more accurate results; for example, 
individuals with greater muscle mass or larger bones will have higher BMIs.
