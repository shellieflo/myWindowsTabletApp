Your lean body mass is the amount of weight you carry on your body that isn't fat.
and anything else in our bodies that has mass and is not fat.

As an aside, for the average adult male about 42% of body weight is skeletal muscle and it’s about 35% for females.

Your lean body mass includes:
1. organs.
2. muscles.
3. bones.
4. skin.
5. blood.

Lean body mass does not necessarily indicate fat free mass. Lean body mass contains a small percentage of fat (roughly 3%) within the central nervous system. It is measured in terms of density.

tracking body fat directly and tracking LBM is helpful to make sure you are losing only fat and no muscle.  Losing muscle is highly undesirable because your metabolism will decrease and aesthetically, you may not look leaner even if you do lose weight.

Lean body mass is also your set point to determine how much fat you should lose and what your body fat percentage will be if you lose a certain amount of fat.  You can check out the Ideal Body Weight Formula, which takes into account your lean body mass to arrive at your ideal weight.
